# Impact of PSF Higher Order Moments Error (HOME) on Weak Lensing (WL)

This repository includes software to quantitatively test the relation between the weak lensing shear bias and the modeling error of PSF higher order moments (beyond second).

It is based on [Zhang et al (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.1978Z/abstract) and incorporates subsequent work that is in a paper to be released in May 2022.
